# Immutable data can't be changed in terms of its value once assigned.

print(ages[0:3])
# prints element 0, 1, 2. In python a tuple collection starts from
# 0 and doesn't includes end point value like if we want to print 1st 2nd 3rd element then to do so we'll have to type 0-4 it would mean print 0,1,2,3 not 4.
