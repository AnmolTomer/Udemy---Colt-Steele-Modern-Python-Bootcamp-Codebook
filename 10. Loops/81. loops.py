# What loops are and how they are useful and their types and iterable objects.
# For loops and while loops and iteration over ranges and strings
# Learn how to control an exiting a loop.
# for loop and while loop we will focus into.
# The idea behind for loop is that we have a collection of data something over which we can iterate over easily or loop through. i.e. loooping over every character in a string or item of list. or a range (1,10)
# Syntax for for loop is
# for item in iterable object:
    # do something with the item.
# An iterable object is some kind of collection of items, for instance a range, list of numbers strings of characters etc.
# item is a new variable declared there itself when we use a for loop and can be named anything and references the current position of the iterator within the iterable.
# This item will iterate over (run through) every item of the collection and then go away when it has visited all times.
# for yamaha:
#     print Photo
#     print Price
#     calc_loc
# for kawai:
#     print Photo
#     print Price
#     calc_loc
# for wurlitzer:
#     print Photo
#     print Price
#     calc_loc

#  For every piano do something and that something is the function that prints stuff and couple of operations that we want.
#  Objectives: Loops and use, how they are useful and  using for and while loop and iterating over ranges and strings.
#  Dicts and lists and later on how to loop through these. How to control exiting a loop and emergency exit.
